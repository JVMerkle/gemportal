# Gemportal
Minimalistic HTTP portal to the Gemini world.

Demo: [jvmerkle.de/gemportal/gemini.circumlunar.space](https://jvmerkle.de/gemportal/gemini.circumlunar.space)

## Motivation
A lot of proxy setups (e.g. the one in my company) love to block ports that are not associated with a common protocol/feature. In order to visit Gemini sites a connection via a "known" port has to be established.

There are HTTP Gemini portals out there already, but sadly they fail to provide their source code and/or a proper license.
