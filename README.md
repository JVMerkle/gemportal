# Gemportal

HTTP portal to the Gemini world.

Demo: [jvmerkle.de/gemportal/gemini.circumlunar.space](https://jvmerkle.de/gemportal/gemini.circumlunar.space)

## Motivation

A lot of firewalls, including the firewall of my employer, block ports that are not associated with a common
protocol/feature. In order to visit Gemini sites a connection via a "known" port has to be established.

There are HTTP Gemini portals out there already, but sadly they fail to provide their source code and/or a proper
license.

## Features

- Variable base HREF support
- Enable/Disable TLS checks
- Input support
- Follow redirects
- Respect robots.txt's
- Dark theme support
