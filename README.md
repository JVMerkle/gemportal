# Gemportal

HTTP portal to the Gemini world.

## Motivation

A lot of firewalls block ports that are not associated with a common protocol/feature. 
In order to visit Gemini sites a connection via a "known" port has to be established.

There are HTTP Gemini portals out there already, but sadly they fail to provide their 
source code and/or a proper license.

## Features

- Variable base HREF support
- Enable/Disable TLS checks
- Input and image support
- Follow redirects
- Respect robots.txt's
- Dark theme support
